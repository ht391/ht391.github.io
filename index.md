## This page is still under construction.
Hi, welcome to this page.
I am ht391, the owner of this page. I am trying to find somewhere to express, explore and record in these unprecedented times. I am currently in Mainland China. I hope I have stable internet access to this page in my remaining life.
I hold a degree related to physics from a uk university with very low gpa but I am still interested in specific areas of it. I have a job on secondary education, to make a living, which also provides me with a lot of free time.
I am trying to know more about introductory Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. I am also interested in some Japanese animation and drama. 


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ht391/ht391.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ht391/ht391.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
